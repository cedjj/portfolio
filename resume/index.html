            </nav>
            <ul>
                <li>Collaborated with a teammate to analyze and model recipe data focused on how cooking time influences recipe
                ratings using a large dataset.</li>
                <li>Performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and hypothesis testing to uncover key trends and relationships,
                including assessing missing data mechanisms via permutation tests</li>
                <li>Built and evaluated baseline and final regression models with feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning,
                followed by a fairness analysis to examine performance across groups.</li>
                <li>Presented results through an thorough web report featuring Plotly visualizations and detailed statistical
                justifications.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Image Processing and Classification Application | Python | January 2024 - May 2024</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Designed and implemented an image processing suite with a custom class for handling and manipulating RGB
                image data.</li>
                <li>Developed a template image processing class with methods like negation, grayscale, blur, and brightness
                adjustments.</li>
                <li>Implemented an Image K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier for image classification, including Euclidean distance
                calculation, neighbor voting, and model fitting, allowing for day/night image classification based on pixel intensity.</li>
                <li>Employed OOP principles to build modular, extensible classes and methods for easy expansion of additional image
                processing and classification techniques.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier for Handwritten Digits | Java | May 2024 - June 2024</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Developed a K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) model using a custom priority queue for digit classification.</li>
                <li>Implemented K-NN algorithm to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using Euclidean distance to
                measure similarity.</li>
                <li>Built a custom priority queue to efficiently identify the k-nearest neighbors for each test image and predict the
                correct digit label via majority voting.</li>
                <li>Processed and normalized image data (28x28 grayscale) into 1-D arrays for model training, improving classification
                accuracy to above 90%.</li>
                <li>Integrated image rendering and visualization tools for testing and displaying the modelâ€™s predictions in a graphical
                interface.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Movie Search Engine | Java | May 2024 - June 2024</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Developed a search engine using BSTs to index and query movie data based on actors, studios, and ratings.</li>
                <li>Created a dynamic query system that returns relevant movie documents based on intersecting keywords, avoiding
                duplicate results</li>
                <li>Implemented case-insensitive search and efficient data handling, ensuring scalability and fast retrieval of results.</li>
            </ul>
