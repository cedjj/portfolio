        "year": 2025,
        "description": "This project uses visualization to compares how processed the products sold at Whole Foods, Walmart, and Target through FPro scores. By visualizing product distributions across each store, the analysis reveals clear differences between stores. Walmart and Target both skew heavily toward highly processed foods, while Whole Foods shows a more balanced spread with a greater share of minimally processed items. These results support the idea that Whole Foods offers less processed products than typical grocery retailers."

        "year": 2025,
        "description": "This project explored if what features of a dataset could predict recipe rating through data analysis and modeling. Starting with a simple baseline model using three numerical features, we achieved an F1 score of 0.741, but needed more complexity to capture user preferences. By engineering features such as nutritional ratios, ingredient patterns, tag encodings, and user behavior signals, and using a tuned Random Forest Classifier, our final model reached an F1 score of 0.87. We showed that enjoyment is influenced by multiple factors and that thoughtful feature engineering can significantly improve predictive performance."

This was an exercise in understanding how visualizations can be used to persuade or deceive an audience depending on the data presented and the design choices made."

        "description": "I developed a K-Nearest Neighbors model that classifies handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset with over 90% accuracy. This involved implementing a custom priority queue to efficiently find the nearest neighbors and processing the 28x28 grayscale images into 1-D arrays for the algorithm. I also integrated visualization tools to display the model's predictions."

The system features a dynamic query function that returns relevant, non-duplicate results by finding intersections between search keywords, with case-insensitive handling for improved usability."
